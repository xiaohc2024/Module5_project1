## Purpose

The "steak survey" dataset that was used for the ["How Americans Like Their Steak"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-americans-like-their-steak/) article, is available through the R package [`fivethirtyeight`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/index.html).
Using this dataset, this article summarizes the steak preferences for the `r params$region` Region of the
United States by gender.

For our summary presented here, a subset of the original steak survey was extracted to only include responses with no missing data and only included respondents from the `r params$region` region of the US. The data subset used for our summary had `r nrow(sdat)` respondents.
